# Advent-Of-Cyber
This will be a log to document my journey on TryHackMe throughout this month. In December they are hosting a festive raffle that focuses on a storyline invloving a parody of "The Grinch Who Stole Christmas". This raffle has many prizes such as tickets for DEFCON and PSVR headsets and much more while learning about Cybersecurity.
